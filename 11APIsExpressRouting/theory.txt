APIs 
    Grouping APIs we need for project
     authRoutes

        POST   /login
        POST   /logout

    profileRouter
        GET    /profile = view
        PATCH  /profile = edit
        PATCH  /profile = password(different for password)
        
        
    connectionRequestRouter
        POST   /request/send/interested/:userID
        POST   /request/send/ignored/:userID
        POST   /request/review/accepted/:requestID
        POST   /request/review/rejected/:requestID

    userRouter
        GET    /user/connections
        GET    /user/requests/received
        GET    /user/feed =>core gets profile of other users 


        STATUS: ignore(left swipe ), interested(right swipe) , accepted , rejected


as we have this much api, we dont just use all in app.js, we use   
    "express.Router"
    - we'll basically group APIs and create routers to handle these


    express.Router() === express()  (almost) 
    so instead we use :
        const router= express.Router()
        router.get('/login')...

        create files in "./src/routers" => add APIs here
        import all the files of this folder into  app.js folder
