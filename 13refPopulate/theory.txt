User Router:
  creating user router containing following APIs:

        checks: 
            -received Logic: toUserID:loggedInUser._id;
            -pengindg Logic: status:interested
    -/user/connections
    -/user/feed

REF/RELATIONS:
    from above stuff, we'll be getting the userId's that we are saving, but we will need names and other info also on the frontend
    1. loop over them and attach info before passing 
    2. or the better way=> BUILD RELATIONS by {ref:"user"} in Schema

Populate:
  await find({}).populate("",["",""]);  =>    populate("attribute from the object we just found",   [this is arrray of properties realted to])
  foundObject=> instance of object we just found
  arrayProperties=> array of properties related to that object in the ref Schema

    it will return our item like:
      .populate("fromUserId" , ["firstName", "lastName"]);  =>  fromUserId:{
                                                                              _id:"eraefaaa",
                                                                              firstName:"jatin",
                                                                              lastName : "bajaj"
                                                                              }
    populate automatically fetches the said attributes















    FROM 1hr 10m => 13-REF Populate, not taking any notes, will write at the very end after redoing the whole project
