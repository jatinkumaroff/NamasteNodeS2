Middlewares:
app.use can be used by all: get/post/patch etc 
app.use("/route",()=>{
    //this function is ROUTE HANDLER
})

if no response is mentioned in ROUTE HANDLER, it will hit infinite loop and will timeout

we can have multiple ROUTE HANDLERS inside a single route:
        app.use("/", ()=>{} , ()=>{} ,... );

        but default only first RH is where flow goes and not in any of subsequent , to use those:
        we add @param= next and call it in the funciton:
        (req,res,next){
            //function body
            next();

            but response is sent ONLY ONCE!!!
        }
