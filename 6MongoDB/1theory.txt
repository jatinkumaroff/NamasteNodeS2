the DB file is created inside config folder , inside src folder

DB using seuence:
    Require mongoose
    Connect your app to DB=> {localhost /OR/ connectionString}
    Create Schema
    Create Model -> in src folder


VERY IMPORTANT THINGS: 
    move the app.listen thing to the db connectino try catch statement:

    this way, server listens only after the DB is connected.... 
    else if our server is running and db is not connected , this can pose some problem!


ALWAYS WRAP ANYTHING INVOLVING DB INSIDE A TRY CATCH BLOCK!!!
