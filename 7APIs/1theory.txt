req body consist of a lot of data and metadata
but req.body consists of json data that we received
to be able to use the json data received from request:
            app.use(express.json())   => is a MUST
            WHAT IS DOES IS =>  converts JSON to JavaScript Object and gives it
                JSON:           {  "key" : "val"   } , at end gives error here
                JS Object:      {   key  : "val" , }


Model.find returns:      Array - if no then empty
Model.findOne returns:   Object- if no then null



TRY Using different http request type for different functions:
        delete 
        patch : update
        post  : submit 
        get   : render



All this is w/o any validation, whatever crap can be passed

there are multiple checks => data sanitisation

min length, correct type, no duplication,privacy etc
