NEVER TRUST req.body , as it just gives us data coming in from an API and any type/amount of

so as the /signup is entry point , we should :  
    1. validation of data                       =>we'll be using UTILITY/HELPER FUNCTIONS for this
    2. encrypt password => store in database



        UTILITY / HELPER FUNCTIONS
            -utils folder inside src
            -validation.js in it
            - create a function that checks body and throw errors 
            - export the function and use it in app.js like:
            - import and just use it in try block of signup : validateSignUpData(req);



        ENCRYPT PASSWORD:
        (done only after validation of signup data)
            -install bcrypt
            -bcrypt.hash(plaintext password, rounds of salt, )
            - as it returns promie, use await bcrypt.hash

            IMP: after securing password at signup, also do the same in updation!
            "FIND A WAY OF HOW TO DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

using bcrypt.hash returns us a promise 



            /login API:
            - check if the mail entered is a valid email using validator
            - check whether user with entered mail is present in database using findOne
                -yes: fetch saved passwordHASH
                -no : return error 
            - password chekcing use await bcrypt.compare => takes plain text pass and hash saved for user and compare both
            - bcrypt.compare => returns bool => async
            - new problem=> getting password for the email entered and putting that into the second args
